                    <p>If you haven't thought about these in planning your higher education from top universities abroad, </p> 
                    
                    <p>âœ”YOU SHOULD THINK NOW!</p>
                    
                    <p>As I have seen many students & settled professionals also struggling on opting a wrong lender and have literally brought their bright careers at the edge of destruction.</p>
                    
                    <p>This document is a just a simple chart for you to see and compare the loans.</p>

                    <p>An education loan aims at sponsoring the college expenses of an individual. Anybody who wishes to study abroad or even in a domestic educational institute can opt for a student or education loan from any of the recognised banks.</p>

                    <p>The basic motive behind the concept of education loan was to help the aspirants economically and not let them murder their dreams due to some economic constraint. Added to this, such loans have only helped many of the students in going overseas without worrying about any financial limitations.</p>
                    
                    <p>Education Loan functions by helping students with their tuition fee, dorm room fee, laptop, books, stationery, travel for as long as they are studying in a college.</p>
                    
                    <p>And you start repaying the principal portion of the education loan six months to a year after finishing the course, or when you get a job, whichever is earlier. The repayments include a tiny sum of interest along with the original loan amount.</p>
                    
                    <p>If you plan to take an education loan, then do get in touch with GyanDhan once before going ahead with the procedure. GyanDhan is an education loan startup by IIT alumni and is working closely with various banks across India (including SBI, Bank of Baroda, Axis Bank etc) in order to help students get the best education loan deal in the shortest time, without any unnecessary hassle.</p>

                    <h3>Choosing your bank:</h3>
                    <p>A number of banks offer educational loans for different courses in India and abroad. They offer unsecured loans for small amounts. Security is required for loans that are required to fund expensive courses. Choose a bank that will provide you with the best moratorium period, interest rate and terms to pay back the loan. Also make sure you have the option of repaying the loan early. Choose the bank that offers you the best loan terms rather than the most finance. Also check if you are allowed to pay EMIs in advance or make part payments towards the loan. Know about all the service charges that are applicable on your loan. Prepayments and part payments might carry a penalty.</p>
